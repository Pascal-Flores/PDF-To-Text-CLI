	<abstract>Abstract This paper investigates a novel application of sup- port vector machines (SVMs) for sentence reduction. We also propose a new probabilistic sentence reduc- tion method based on support vector machine learn- ing. Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform earlier methods in term of sen- tence reduction performance.</abstract>
